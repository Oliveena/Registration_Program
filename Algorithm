Start

    Understand the Program's Purpose
        Figure out what the program is meant to do, like managing course registrations.

    Compile a List of Classes
        Write down all the classes that will be part of the program.(course, student, register, and main class: studentform)
        For each class, describe what itâ€™s responsible for.
		course: course name, course ID, semester, professor
		student: first name, last name, student ID, program
		register: registration date, number of course, classroom mode

    Define User Scenarios
        Create all lists fit with its methods
        Link everything to the appropriate classes.

    Evaluate Class Responsibilities
        For each class:
            Make sure it focuses on its responsibility.
            Check that it deals with a specific function or feature.

    Examine Class Interactions
        Look at how the classes will work together:
            Identify the main class that runs the program (where the main method: studentform is).
            Note any helper classes that offer common functions.

    Adopt an Iterative Development Approach
        Start with class one-by-one based on order and priority to work on.
        Once you finish a class, test it to make sure it works.
        Proceed to the next class in the list.

    Review and Improve
        After the initial versions of the classes:
	    Check if they run within themselves.
            Check how they interact with each other.
            Refine the code to enhance their connection and minimize unnecessary dependencies.
